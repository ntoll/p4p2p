P4P2P - Platform for Peer-to-Peer
=================================

A small and simple framework for making peer to peer applications.

There are two broad aspects to this framework:

1. Peer discover and communication.
2. Application deployment and execution.

There's not a lot here right now.

Developer Setup
+++++++++++++++

Make a new virtualenv (see:
http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)::

    $ mkvirtualenv p4p2p

Install the requirements::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

The ``make`` command is a useful starting point.
