Contributing to P4P2P
---------------------

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve P4P2P.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.

Submit an Issue
+++++++++++++++

* Use GitHub's built in issue tracker to report bugs and suggest improvements.

* When reporting a bug explain what you were doing, what you expected to
  happen, what actually happened and the steps needed to recreate the problem.

* When requesting an improvement please describe the problem you want solving,
  why it's important and potential costs / benefits to the project.

* Ensure you're not duplicating an existing issue.

* Submitting an issue is no guarantee that it'll be addressed (and it may even
  be rejected).

Copyright Status
++++++++++++++++

I (Nicholas H.Tollervey) would like to keep the copyright status of this
project as simple as possible. To this end, any contribution to the source code
(including documentation) will be subject to the following conditions:

* The contribution was created by the contributor who confirms they have the
  right to submit it under the GNU Affero Public License version 3.

* The contribution is either completely original or based upon previous work
  that is also covered by a compatible license.

* Since all development of P4P2P is done in public, the contribution will
  be made public.

* There is no guarantee that a contribution will be accepted in to the source
  code.

Code Contribution Checklist
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Ensure your contribution is linked to an outstanding ticket in the issue
  tracker.

* Create a new branch for your contribution with a descriptive name and
  reference to the issue number. For example: 865342-add-blue-widget

* Create the pull request from your *new* branch to the remote (i.e. my)
  master branch.

* Alternatively, send me a patch file (see git patch) via email with a
  description of the work done. ;-)

* Make sure you include tests!

* Your code should be commented in *plain English*.

* Ensure you run ``make check`` to tell you that you're following PEP8,
  PyFlakes isn't complaining about redundant code, all the tests pass and you
  have as close to 100% test coverage as is possible.

* Did I mention you should include tests..? Yeah, include tests.

* If you've not done so already, add yourself to the AUTHORS file.
