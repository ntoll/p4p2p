    A bucket to store contact information about other nodes in the network.
    From the original Kademlia paper:

    "Kademlia nodes store contact information about each other to route query
    messages. For each 0 <= i < 160, every node keeps a list of <IP address,
    port, Node ID> triples for nodes of distance between 2i and 2(i+1) from
    itself. We call these lists k-buckets. Each k-bucket is kept sorted by time
    last seen -- least-recently seen node at the head, most-recently seen at
    the tail. For small values of i, the k-buckets will generally be empty (as
    no appropriate nodes will exist). For large values of i, the lists can
    grow to size k, where k is a system-wide replication parameter. k is
    chosen such that any given k nodes are very unlikely to fail within an
    hour of each other (for example k = 20)"

    Nota Bene: This implementation of Kademlia uses a 512 bit key space
    based upon SHA512 rather than the original 160 bit SHA1 implementation, so
    i will be < 512.
